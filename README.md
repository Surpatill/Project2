1. Data Cleaning: Combined and preprocessed the three datasets.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examined distribution, summary statistics, and visualized data.
3. Skewness Analysis: Identified and addressed skewed variables.
4. Correlation Analysis: Investigated relationships between variables using partial correlation.

Tools and Techniques:
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pingouin.
- Data visualization: heatmaps, scatter plots.
- Statistical analysis: partial correlation.
